# Detecting-Fake-News
Detecting fake news is a critical challenge in today's information age. In this project, we will use Python to build a machine learning model to differentiate between real and fake news. We will apply a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, a popular algorithm for text classification. By the end of this project, you will have a better understanding of data exploration, model building, and performance evaluation in text classification.
PassiveAggressiveClassifier:
 This algorithm is particularly effective for online learning and text classification tasks.
